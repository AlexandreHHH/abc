# Why is it relevant?
For [[Martin Heidegger\|Martin Heidegger]], the concept of Being has been forgotten in [[history\|history]]. But, how was this possible? In the beggining of [[Philosophy\|Philosophy]], [[Socrates\|Socrates]]/[[Plato\|Plato]] (this is a debatable topic, in which I won't enter to much in detail - it is said that Socrates didn't exist and Plato was responsible for the writings of [[Socratic dialogs\|Socratic dialogs]]) used to debate they're contemporany fellow people about the **real meaning** of words like [[Courage\|Courage]], [[Virtue\|Virtue]], etc. If you imagine a [[onion\|onion]], you have several layers. The greeks tried to understand what is the last layer of the [[onion\|onion]] from which the other layers we're based upon.    

Unfortunately, this question, according to Heidegger was lost throughtout time, it was forgotten. Why it was forgotten? One explanation is [[Language\|Language]]. The [[Language\|Language]] created epistemological dichotomies that later made the question *What is being?* forgotten. More than that, we seem to use this word unconscious, at least when the morphological ([[Morphology\|Morphology]]) structure is changed. Here are some examples:
- What **is** the meaning of life? 
- There **is** rain.

The attempt of [[Martin Heidegger\|Martin Heidegger]] in *On [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]] and [[Time\|Time]]* is to elaborate a new philosophy, in which he wished to include the concept of [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]], in order to uncover him from the of [[history\|history]]. More than that, he is going to pair the concept of [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]] with the concept of [[Time\|Time]]. I will explain more of this pairness down below. 

# Integrate this idea into the bigger picture 
As I said before, the question of [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]] started in Ancient [[Greece\|Greece]]. But, Socrates/Plato weren't only the ones that disccussed and tried to give a solution to this problem. This arises the question: Then, who disscused about the question of being?

Before, [[Socrates\|Socrates]]/[[Plato\|Plato]], the presocratic philosopher [[Parmenides\|Parmenides]] is engaged in the problem of [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]], while contrasting it to non-[[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]]. I won't touch too much this subject, but he insisted that non-[[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]], in comparison to [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]], is not able to exist, because it is [[Nothing\|Nothing]] itself. 

What about after the Ancient period? Some theologians, like [[Thomas Aquinas\|Thomas Aquinas]], [[Giordano Bruno\|Giordano Bruno]] and [[Spinoza\|Spinoza]] also approach this subject, but they we're more interested in what made [[God\|God]] so special. When I say "special", I mean that [[God\|God]] in comparison to humans, is already maxxed out (to use the terminology of [[Gaming\|Gaming]]). He is [[Omnibenevolent\|Omnibenevolent]], [[Omniscient\|Omniscient]], [[Omnipotent\|Omnipotent]] and so on. [[God\|God]] is [[perfection\|perfection]], while humans are not. Let's get back to the analogy of the onion. I said that it has several layers. The last layer is the one that every other layer is based upon. If that layer doesn't exist, than the other layers cannot exists. The question that I'm going to ask is the following: What is the ultimate layer of [[God\|God]]? Some said it was [[essence\|essence]], other [[Substance\|Substance]]. In any case, those mean, somehow, the same thing. Is it a thing that is not dependent on another thing. The *ultimate layer* for [[God\|God]], won't need something else to exists, because he is not dependent on it, while a building might be dependent on a builder in order to exists.     

Another philosopher who stressed out on the problem of [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]] was [[Rene Descartes\|Rene Descartes]].  
# The actual content told like a story.  
Now, it should be a clearer understanding on the problem of [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]]. But, still, what is [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]]? 

Asking this question is like trying to find an answer to another questions, which sounds something like: *What really makes a car, a car?* Is it the engine, the wheels? Not quite. The engine and the wheels are things that makes a car being visible, or in heideggerian terminology, [[Ontic\|Ontic]]. This word simply means that something is objectively  simply accesible to others. Everyone can see a car, anyone can touch it. If it is more simply to understand, extrinsic can also be helpful. This brings another word, which is *Seindes*, which in german means [[beings\|beings]]. [[Ontic\|Ontic]] is the property of being objectively accesible to all senses, and [[beings\|beings]] refers to the material things, like a bicycle or a computer. More than that, this word is responding to the question *What is?*
   
But, those words are not enough to answer the question of [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]]. We are not dealing with something physical, like the monitor or the keyboards. This "ultimate layer" is actualy non-physical? At least, this is what the philosophers and theoogians after Heidegger admitted to say. So, he also followed the same path. Something that is not physical, or the property of being non-physical is [[ontological\|ontological]], or intrinsec. The [[thought\|thought]], the [[mind\|mind]] or the [[emotion\|emotion]] are not accesible objectively, but subjectively. If one person, right now on earth, feels that he fallen in love, then this emotion will be only accesible to him and his crush will never know it.    

It is still enough in order to understand the question of [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]]? Yes, but the image is still empty. Why is that? Reading through the heideggerian books and terminology is like travelling into a forest labyrinth. If the [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]] is [[ontological\|ontological]], then how are you gonna acces it? Is it enought to ask *Who?* You can have a thought and an emotion, but how are gonna be so certain that you're gonna know for sure what is it? Is this really the actual thought that I had? Is this really the actual emotions that I had? The *Seindes* are able to answer to the question *What?*, but not to the question of *Who?* and this is the timp Heidegger brings another word into his philosophy, which is called [[Dasein\|Dasein]]. 

In order to understand this word, the first thing is to break it into several pieces, like a baby who is destroying his toy in order to explore the world around him. *Da*, in german, unlike in romanian in russian, means *here*, *now*. Then, *Sein*, is the equivalent of the english term [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]]. In conjuction, it resulted "[[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]] now". So, why is it so special, in comparison to other *seindes*? 

First of all, it is a type of *seindes*. While there are things that are accesible to everyone, like a car or a cake, [[Dasein\|Dasein]] is actually accesible and non-accesible. So, this means that  is it capable of responding to the questions of *How?* and *What * and *Who?*. If yes, then, how is this possible?

The special trait of [[Dasein\|Dasein]] is the ability to reflect upon itself. So, if the [[Zettelkasten/Being\|Being]] of something would hold a mirror, he'll see himself. [[Dasein\|Dasein]] beings upon himself. This special trait is only available for humans. I think the reason for this is because the humans are the only creature on this planet (and of universe as we know for now know) that are self-[[consciousness\|consciousness]]. Of course, Heidieggger is telling notthing about this and this is just my interpretation. I don't really want to enter too much into the details here, but being self-[[conscious\|conscious]] is like knowing that you know, or being aware that you are aware. 

[[Dasein\|Dasein]] is capable of being-in-the-world. What does it really mean? I'm going to penetrate into the word *world*, because is pretty tricky in the heideggerian terminology. 

One meaning related to the fact that there is not just one [[Dasein\|Dasein]] in this world. The human population is around 8 billion... For every 8 billion people there is one Dasein. 

Another meaning is that Dasein is both ontological and ontic or intrinsic and extrinsic. I think this is possible because of the special trait of self-reflecting.   

As I said, we are talking about many Daseins. Every human has one. So, how do they relate to eachother? How does one Dasein relates to the objects? A concept for which Heidegger is stressing out a lot is [[Care\|Care]], and I'm not talking about fashion. [[Care\|Care]] for Heiddegger, is like a mom who is treating his child, (or should be), or a friend who is helping you out. What is happening when someone is getting help from someone else. What happens to a Daseins, when it gets help from another Dasein? For Heidegger, there are two possible results for that? First of all, the Dasein is forgotton, is being put under the rock, so that everything is dissapearing. There are people (P2) who received a major help from another person (P2) and nstead of being selfish, they felt that they needed to give something in return. What did P1 realised? He put a rock under the P2 Dasein. They're are not anymore self-aware of themselves. Another case is when one Dasein might get under a rock temporary. I would take the same example. But, P2, instead didn't lose they're Dasein and they would not be so willing to make the favor in return to P1, at least not for they're entire life. They might be graciously to P1 but after a while, they forgot the help and they are back into they're Dasein. Because we are talking about the relationship of other Daseins, and how the Dasein of one human might be forgotten, because is not something sticky and can be in many case be in underattack is fair to bring into the discussion the archetypal nemesis of *Dasein*, that is the *Impersonal is*.

So, I compared [[Dasein\|Dasein]] to self-consciousness, the ability of being aware of what you're aware. Then, I insisted that this [[Dasein\|Dasein]], even if is "inside you", this doesn't mean that it will not be forgotton. The [[Dasein\|Dasein]] can be threated by either the help of one [[Dasein\|Dasein]], or by the society, in general. What do I mean by that? In the publich space, [[Dasein\|Dasein]] is in relation, in connection to other social structures, like work, or social responsabilities. The human attention instead of being focused into what he is living inside him ([[Dasein\|Dasein]]), he is concentrated into what is outside him, on what is really impersonal. This is we're the archetypal nemesis is knocking the door, throwing the door into your face, leaving blood and suffering. The boss is telling you that you should not exists. Your mom is upset because you don't listen to his dogmatic beliefs. The teacher is mad because you didn't studied. Just like a bullet, that is injecting itself into the body of the unlucky, this is creating the possibility of the Dasein to be forgetton by the human. The shift, from self-consciousness to outside self-consciousness is happening. 

Even if he doesn't say it directly, Heidegger here might suggests that the *Impersonal isu* might be neccesary. (Necessary Evil). In order to attain the-fact-self-authenticity, the human must pass itself to the path of the *Impersonal is* to the [[Dasein\|Dasein]]. In order for [[Dasein\|Dasein]] to exist, in other words, the [[Impersonal Is\|Impersonal Is]] must exist.

What about the relationship between objects and [[Dasein\|Dasein]]. The-fact-of-being-useful is understood by something that has the ability of being useful. Simple-presence is about a thing that exists, but doesn't have a utility in itself. It is just there. But, a thing that is simple-presence, can become a thing of the-fact-of-being-useful. I will give the following analogy. The mountain, when someone is looking at it, is simple-presence. But, when he realised that the mountains contains free cash, he is gonna get it. The usefulness, the fact-of-being useful is found into the value of the mountain. Another way to see the usefulness of something is by seeing the results of it. One can see a shovel to be useful, because you can dig in a grave. Another can see the mountain being useful, because he will make him rich, and so on. This examples are relating to the ontic, extrinsic facts. More than that, after something becomes useless, it losses the fact-of-being-useful and gets back to the simple-presence. Think, of a mouse. After the right or left click's buttons are destroyed, it is no longer useful, because you cannot interact with the screen anymore. Another fundamental element is the fact that this is making [[Dasein\|Dasein]] capable of apearing.   
 
# Do you have any other questions?
1. Does self-[[consciousness\|consciousness]] is the same thing, more or else, with [[Dasein\|Dasein]]?
# Did you identify any gaps in your explication?
2. I'm not sure how to explain the philosophical implications of Descartes into the problem of Being.
3. I don't think that Giordano Bruno or Spinoza we're engaged in the problem of being. rof  
4. I'm not able to explain why Dasein is ontological and ontic. u
5. I should be more clarely and cautiosly on the analogy in regards of P1 and P2. 
6. I'm not sure of how [[Dasein\|Dasein]] can appear after an object is no longer useful. 
7.
